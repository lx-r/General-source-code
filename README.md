- **General-source-code,Implement the common machine learning algorithm with python**
### 1.logistic regression
  - **Introduction in detail at this [link](https://blog.csdn.net/lx_ros/article/details/81254937)**
### 2.nerual network and backpropagation
  - **Introduction in detail at this [link](https://blog.csdn.net/lx_ros/article/details/81123525)**
### 3.(SVM)Multiclass Support Vector Machine
  - **the implementation of [CS231n](http://cs231n.github.io/linear-classify/)**
### 4.Soft_max Classifier
  - **the expaination of this algorithm in detail on the [blog](https://blog.csdn.net/lx_ros/article/details/81329500)**
### 5.K_Nearest_Neighbot
  - **Since the data used in this example is very little and the image is gray, so the knn method have a not too better result.The explaination on the [blog](https://blog.csdn.net/lx_ros/article/details/81358198)**
### 6.Percepron Learning Algorithm
  - **This is the implementation of the PLA with the instrution of HT Lin's course on Coursera.The detail in this [blog](https://blog.csdn.net/lx_ros/article/details/80573147)**
